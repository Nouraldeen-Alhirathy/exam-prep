# ExamPrep

## Project Description

ExamPrep is a simple app that turns written question banks into an interactive learning experience, allowing users to study and/or test their knowledge in the subject of the question bank. The app provides a variety of features to enhance the learning process:

- **Question Bank**: Users can study a collection of questions organized in a question bank. The questions are displayed with options to show or hide answers.
- **Quiz Generator**: Users can generate quizzes based on the question bank. The quizzes can be customized with options like the number of questions, shuffling questions, and shuffling choices.
- **Practice Quiz**: Users can take practice quizzes generated from the question bank. The result is displayed at the end of the quiz.
- **Storage Services**: The project uses IndexedDB or LocalStorage to save and retrieve quiz configurations and user preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: The project includes various CSS utilities and components to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

The project structure includes HTML files for different pages, JavaScript files for functionality, and CSS files for styling.
